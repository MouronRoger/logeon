# Perseus Dictionary Scraper - Progress Report

## Project Evolution

This project has evolved from its initial goal of scraping the Logeion dictionary to now focusing on the Perseus Digital Library's Liddell-Scott-Jones (LSJ) Greek-English Lexicon.

## Key Changes

1. **Target Change**: Switched from Logeion to Perseus Tufts as the data source
2. **Technology Approach**: 
   - Removed Playwright dependency 
   - Now using direct URL access instead of browser automation
   - Using requests + BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing
3. **Storage**: Using SQLite for efficient storage and retrieval (instead of just JSON)

## Implementation Progress

### Completed
- Direct URL access to Perseus LSJ dictionary
- Greek letter and entry extraction
- SQLite database storage
- HTML content parsing
- JSON export functionality

### Current Approach
Instead of navigating through a JavaScript-heavy interface, we now access the Perseus dictionary entries directly through URL patterns. This has:
- Simplified the code significantly
- Removed the need for browser automation
- Improved reliability and speed
- Made the tool more portable

## Next Steps

1. Extend to other lexicons in the Perseus Digital Library
2. Add more comprehensive coverage of Greek words
3. Implement a web interface for browsing the extracted data
4. Improve data processing and structure for better usability
